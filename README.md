## About Me
I am a third-year PhD student working with the <a href="https://nexs.scs.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">NEXS group</a> at the College of Computing in Georgia Tech, Atlanta. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.anand-iyer.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Anand Iyer</a>. My research centers on building efficient systems for large language models, vision language models and multi-modal models. I am interested in understanding and thereby optimizing inference and post-training foundational models across diverse hardware platforms.

### Ongoing Research
- Building systems to merge LLM models in the wild for memory reduction.
- First system that optimizes Mixture of Expert inference through expert reduction while being workload-agnostic and maintaining accuracy through runtime systems and kernel optimization. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08982)

### What's new!
- Passed Systems Qualifying Examination oral component! (Nov 2025)

### Experience
I was a research intern at Microsoft Research at Systems Research group (2025) and AI Frameworks team (2024), where I had the privelege of working on multi-instance LLM scheduling and kernel optimization for large-scale systems on real workloads. At [Cerebras Systems](https://www.cerebras.net/) (2022), I worked as an ML Compilers Intern to accelerated sparse attention in LLMs through MLIR transformation passes.

I started my foray into computing systems as a physical design Engineer at <a href="https://www.arm.com/" target="_blank">Arm</a> where I had the opportunity to work on Arm V7-V9 cores (4nm, 5nm, 11nm). During my undergraduate years, I was interested in visible light communication which resulted in my first publication, <a href="docs/papers/Performance_Analysis_of_a_Visible_Light_Vehicle-To-Vehicle_Wireless_Communication_System.pdf" target="_blank">foggy channel modelling</a> for autonomous vehicles which received the Best Paper Award at IMICPW.

During my masters, my curiousity in quantum computing systems led me to work on designing efficient qubit mapping and scheduling for trapped-ion quantum computers with <a href="http://prod.tinker.cc.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">TINKER group</a> under <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/tom-conte" target="_blank">Dr. Tom Conte</a> (Master's thesis). I also co-founded PACE (Physcial Activity and Care for Everyone), a fitness [startup](https://create-x.gatech.edu/) with CREATE-X (Georgia Tech's startup incubator) for remote physical therapy using computer vision. I also dabbled in cognitive science research, where we tried to teach neural networks how to count in the pre-ChatGPT era with [Dr. Sashank Varma](https://psychology.gatech.edu/sashank-varma). <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/91z2p9h1" target="_blank">CogSci'22 Poster</a> [CogSci'24 Paper](https://escholarship.org/content/qt5cz2v6d5/qt5cz2v6d5_noSplash_d89a45b032c07c6c0d0c5cfca8df2884.pdf)

Here is my [Resume](docs/papers/Vima_Gupta_PhD_updated (5).pdf) for your perusal!

### Interests
I love dancing, and found myself going for Bachata classes. I like reading (or lately, collecting) books on mythology, behavioral psychology and medival history. I feel energized noticing the little details in pop-culture, behind-the-scene takes on TV series and films. I am an avid quizzing. I enjoy late brunches (happy to suggest cafes in the 2 mile GaTech perimeter) and indie music. I have recently gotten into coloring and excited to try my hands on pottery this semester!
