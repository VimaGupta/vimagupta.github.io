## About Me
I am a third-year PhD student in Systems for Machine Learning at Georgia Tech, advised by Dr. Anand Iyer. My research centers on building efficient systems for large language model (LLM) inference across diverse hardware platforms, focusing on reducing memory footprint and latency without compromising performance.

### Ongoing Research
- Building systems to merge LLM models in the wild for substantial memory reduction.
- Optimizing Mixture of Expert model inference through runtime information and kernel optimization. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08982)
- Designing efficient qubit mapping and scheduling for trapped-ion quantum computers with <a href="http://prod.tinker.cc.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">TINKER group</a> under <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/tom-conte" target="_blank">Dr. Tom Conte</a>. (Master's thesis)
- Teaching neural networks how to count with [Dr. Sashank Varma](https://psychology.gatech.edu/sashank-varma). <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/91z2p9h1" target="_blank">CogSci'22 Poster</a> | [CogSci'24 Paper](https://escholarship.org/content/qt5cz2v6d5/qt5cz2v6d5_noSplash_d89a45b032c07c6c0d0c5cfca8df2884.pdf)

### What's new!
- Passed Systems Qualifying Examination oral component! (Nov 2025)

### Experience
**Research Intern** at Microsoft Research - Systems Research group (2025) and AI Frameworks team (2024), working on multi-instance LLM scheduling and kernel optimization for production inference.

**ML Compiler Intern** at [Cerebras Systems](https://www.cerebras.net/) (2022) - Accelerated sparse attention in LLMs through MLIR transformation passes.

**Design Engineer** at <a href="https://www.arm.com/" target="_blank">Arm</a> - Physical design implementation for Arm V7-V9 cores (4nm, 5nm, 11nm). Also worked on <a href="docs/papers/Performance_Analysis_of_a_Visible_Light_Vehicle-To-Vehicle_Wireless_Communication_System.pdf" target="_blank">foggy channel modelling</a> for autonomous vehicles (Best Paper Award at IMICPW).

Co-founded PACE, a fitness [startup](https://create-x.gatech.edu/) with CREATE-X for remote physical therapy using computer vision.
