## About Me

I am a third-year CS Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech, advised by [Dr. Anand Iyer](https://www.anand-iyer.com/) in the [NEXS group](https://nexs.scs.gatech.edu/). My research focuses on **building efficient systems for large language model inference**—from CUDA kernel optimization to runtime scheduling to model compression.

I work on production-scale challenges: multi-model serving, mixture-of-experts inference, and adaptive systems that respond to real workload patterns. I've interned at Microsoft Research (2024, 2025) and Cerebras Systems.

I am honored to have received the **Adobe Research Women in Technology Scholarship** and the **EPFL EDIC Fellowship**.

### Earlier Work

During my masters, I worked on qubit mapping for trapped-ion quantum computers with [Dr. Tom Conte](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/tom-conte) (Master's thesis). I also co-founded [PACE](https://create-x.gatech.edu/) through CREATE-X, building pose-detection systems for remote physical therapy.

### Beyond Research

I'm an avid quizzer (placed 3rd nationally as a kid), take Bachata classes, and collect books on mythology and medieval history. I enjoy catching details in films and behind-the-scenes takes on TV shows. Always happy to recommend brunch spots near Georgia Tech.
