## About Me
I am a third-year PhD student in Systems for Machine Learning at the College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology. I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. Anand Iyer. My research centers on building efficient systems for large language model (LLM) inference across diverse hardware platforms. I am driven by curiosity about how to sculpt the cognitive core of LLMs to reduce their memory footprint and latency overhead without compromising performance.

My work sits at the intersection of systems optimization and machine learning, where I combine low-level hardware insights with high-level algorithmic understanding to make state-of-the-art AI models more accessible. Through my research and advanced coursework in distributed systems, I aim to push the boundaries of what's possible in efficient AI deployment.

### Ongoing Research
- Building innovative systems to merge disparate LLM models in the wild, achieving substantial memory footprint reductions while preserving their collective intelligence.
- Optimizing inference latency for Mixture of Expert models by leveraging runtime information and kernel optimization. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08982)
- Designing efficient qubit mapping, routing and scheduling for noisy trapped-ion based quantum computers, with <a href="http://prod.tinker.cc.gatech.edu/" target="_blank"> TINKER group </a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/tom-conte" target="_blank">Dr. Tom Conte</a>. (Master's thesis)
- Teaching neural networks how to count, exploring fundamental questions in machine cognition under the guidance of [Dr. Sashank Varma](https://psychology.gatech.edu/sashank-varma). <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/91z2p9h1" target="_blank"> Poster at CogSci'22! </a>.

### What's new!
- Recently passed the oral component of Systems Qualifying Examination towards the PhD requirement! (Nov 2025)
- Completed back-to-back internships at Microsoft Research, contributing to production-scale LLM systems (2024-2025)

### Experience
I was a research intern at Microsoft Research with the Systems Research group (2025) and AI Frameworks team (2024) where I designed multi-instance LLM scheduling algorithms and enriched hand-written kernels for production inference systems, directly impacting millions of users.

During summer of 2022, I explored cutting-edge ML compiler frameworks for [Cerebras Systems](https://www.cerebras.net/), where I had the opportunity to accelerate sparse attention mechanisms on LLMs through MLIR transformation passes. Previously, I co-founded PACE, a fitness [startup](https://create-x.gatech.edu/) with CREATE-X, aimed at democratizing physical therapy through deep learning and computer vision techniques.

Prior to my master's, I was a Design Engineer at <a href="https://www.arm.com/" target="_blank"> Arm </a> where I worked on physical design implementation of high performance and low power designs at the sub-system level for Arm V7-V9 cores (4nm, 5nm and 11nm) through floorplan co-design for heterogeneous architectures. During my undergrad, I also worked on <a href="docs/papers/Performance_Analysis_of_a_Visible_Light_Vehicle-To-Vehicle_Wireless_Communication_System.pdf" target="_blank"> foggy channel modelling </a> for autonomous vehicles that led to Best Paper Award at IMICPW. You can find my resume <a href="docs/papers/Vima_Gupta_PhD_updated (5).pdf" target="_blank"> here </a>.

### Interests and Hobbies
In my free time, I delve into topics spanning mythology, psychology and ancient history, finding unexpected connections to modern computational challenges. I am also a huge TV show and movie buff and enjoy casual quizzing.
